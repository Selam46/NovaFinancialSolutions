# Interim Report on Nova Financial Solutions

## Project Understanding

### Business Objective

The objective of the Nova Financial Solutions project is to develop tools for analyzing financial data, focusing on quantitative analysis and visualization of stock prices and related metrics. This project aims to provide insights into market trends, helping users make informed financial decisions.

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Financial News Dataset

In Task 1, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a financial news dataset. This analysis aimed to understand the dataset's structure, identify key metrics, and uncover initial insights about the articles.

##### Findings from Task 1

##### Data Overview:

The dataset contains several columns, including headline, publisher, and publication_date.
Summary statistics revealed significant variations in the lengths of headlines, with a wide range of character counts.

##### Missing Values:

Initial checks for missing values indicated that some publishers had incomplete entries, highlighting data quality issues that may affect subsequent analyses.

##### Headline Length Analysis:

A new column, headline_length, was created to analyze the distribution of headline lengths. The histogram indicated that most headlines ranged between 60 to 80 characters, suggesting a common practice in news article formulation.

##### Publisher Activity:

The analysis of article counts per publisher showed that certain publishers dominate the dataset. This insight can guide further analysis into content trends from different sources.

##### Publication Trends:

Trends over time revealed peaks in article publications during specific years, indicating increased media coverage during those periods, possibly correlating with significant financial events.

### Task 2: Data Visualization and Analysis

In Task 2, we focused on visualizing the data and performing more in-depth analysis, particularly looking at sentiment analysis of the headlines and publication trends.

##### Findings from Task 2

##### Sentiment Analysis:

Using the Sentiment Intensity Analyzer from the NLTK library, sentiment scores for each headline were calculated. The distribution of sentiment scores showed that most headlines had neutral to slightly positive sentiments, which is typical for financial news focused on reporting rather than opinion.

##### Visualizations:

Various visualizations were created, including:
Distribution of Headline Lengths: A histogram showcasing the variation in headline lengths.
Top Publishers Bar Chart: A bar chart that visually represents the number of articles published by the top 10 publishers, clearly highlighting the most prolific sources.
Publication Trends Over Time: A line chart illustrating the number of articles published annually, which indicated a noticeable increase in 2020, likely due to the global pandemic and its financial implications.

##### Challenges Encountered:

Data quality issues arose due to missing values and inconsistencies in publication dates. Strategies to tackle these challenges included data cleaning and imputation techniques to ensure robust analysis moving forward.
Additionally, integrating sentiment analysis required careful handling of text data, which necessitated additional preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy.

### Project Progression

The project is progressing well, with significant milestones achieved in both tasks. The next steps include:
Data Cleaning: Addressing missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset to improve the quality of analysis.
Advanced Analysis: Further exploration of the relationship between sentiment and publication dates, as well as correlation with market trends.
Final Reporting: Preparing a comprehensive report that compiles findings from both tasks.

#### Areas of Focus

Enhancing Visualizations: Improving the clarity and depth of visual representations to better communicate findings.
Integrating Additional Data Sources: Exploring the inclusion of stock price data to correlate with the sentiment and publication trends observed in the news articles.
